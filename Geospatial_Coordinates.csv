List of postal codes of Canada: M
This is a list of postal codes in Canada where the first letter is M. Postal codes beginning with M are located
"within the city of Toronto in the province of Ontario. Only the first three characters are listed, corresponding"
to the Forward Sortation Area.
"Canada Post provides a free postal code look-up tool on its website,[1]via its applications for such"
"smartphones as the iPhone and BlackBerry,[2] and sells hard-copy directories and CD-ROMs. Many vendors"
"also sell validation tools, which allow customers to properly match addresses and postal codes. Hard-copy"
"directories can also be consulted in all post offices, and some libraries."
Toronto - 103 FSAs
"Note: There are no rural FSAs in Toronto, hence no postal codes should start with M0. However, the postal"
"code M0R 8T0 is assigned to an Amazon warehouse in Mississauga, suggesting that Canada Post may have"
reserved the M0 FSA for high volume addresses.
